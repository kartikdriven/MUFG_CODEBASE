Definition\n","Association Rule Mining is an **unsupervised learning technique** used to find **relationships or patterns** between items in large datasets, often used in **market basket analysis**.  \n","\n","- Example: \"Customers who buy **bread and butter** also often buy **jam**.\"\n","\n","The **Apriori Algorithm** is one of the most popular algorithms for mining **frequent itemsets** and generating **association rules**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Key Concepts\n","1. **Itemset**: A collection of one or more items (e.g., {milk, bread}).  \n","2. **Support**: The fraction of transactions containing the itemset.  \n","   \\[\n","   \\text{Support}(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of transactions containing A}}{\\text{Total transactions}}\n","   \\]  \n","3. **Confidence**: How often items in B appear in transactions that contain A.  \n","   \\[\n","   \\text{Confidence}(A \\rightarrow B) = \\frac{\\text{Support}(A \\cup B)}{\\text{Support}(A)}\n","   \\]  \n","4. **Lift**: Measures how much more likely B is bought when A is bought, compared to random chance.  \n","   \\[\n","   \\text{Lift}(A \\rightarrow B) = \\frac{\\text{Confidence}(A \\rightarrow B)}{\\text{Support}(B)}\n","   \\]\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Apriori Algorithm Steps\n","1. **Generate candidate itemsets** of length 1.  \n","2. **Prune itemsets** that do not satisfy minimum support.  \n","3. Generate candidate itemsets of length k from frequent itemsets of length k-1.  \n","4. Repeat until no more frequent itemsets are found.  \n","5. Generate **association rules** from frequent itemsets using minimum confidence threshold.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Applications\n","- Market basket analysis (retail, e-commerce)  \n","- Recommendation systems  \n","- Cross-selling and upselling strategies  \n","- Web usage mining (pages frequently visited together)\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Advantages\n","- Simple and interpretable rules  \n","- Finds hidden patterns in transactional data  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. Limitations\n","- Can generate a **large number of rules** for big datasets  \n","- Sensitive to **support and confidence thresholds**  \n","- Only finds **frequent patterns**; rare but important patterns may be missed  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7. Implementation in Python\n","- Libraries: `mlxtend` provides `apriori` and `association_rules` functions.  \n","- Steps:\n","  1. Convert transactional data to **one-hot encoded format**  \n","  2. Use `apriori()` to find frequent itemsets  \n","  3. Use `association_rules()` to extract rules with **confidence, support, lift**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"LrPOErTefYUL"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"m5ybYyydfAP3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759552431915,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2128,"user":{"displayName":"Kartik Rajesh Patel","userId":"13704250535376199674"}},"outputId":"0c7ed0a4-f279-4af9-b9e8-d4248c8909f8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["One-hot encoded transaction data:\n","\n","   bread  butter    jam   milk\n","0   True    True  False   True\n","1   True    True  False  False\n","2   True   False  False   True\n","3   True    True   True   True\n","4   True    True   True  False\n","5   True    True  False   True\n","6   True   False   True  False\n","7   True    True  False   True\n","\n","Frequent Itemsets:\n","\n","   support               itemsets\n","0    1.000                (bread)\n","1    0.750               (butter)\n","2    0.625                 (milk)\n","3    0.750        (bread, butter)\n","4    0.625          (milk, bread)\n","5    0.500         (milk, butter)\n","6    0.500  (milk, bread, butter)\n","\n","Association Rules:\n","\n","      antecedents      consequents  support  confidence      lift\n","0         (bread)         (butter)    0.750        0.75  1.000000\n","1        (butter)          (bread)    0.750        1.00  1.000000\n","2          (milk)          (bread)    0.625        1.00  1.000000\n","3          (milk)         (butter)    0.500        0.80  1.066667\n","4   (milk, bread)         (butter)    0.500        0.80  1.066667\n","5  (milk, butter)          (bread)    0.500        1.00  1.000000\n","6          (milk)  (bread, butter)    0.500        0.80  1.066667\n","\n","Rules sorted by lift:\n","\n","      antecedents      consequents  support  confidence      lift\n","6          (milk)  (bread, butter)    0.500        0.80  1.066667\n","4   (milk, bread)         (butter)    0.500        0.80  1.066667\n","3          (milk)         (butter)    0.500        0.80  1.066667\n","2          (milk)          (bread)    0.625        1.00  1.000000\n","1        (butter)          (bread)    0.750        1.00  1.000000\n","0         (bread)         (butter)    0.750        0.75  1.000000\n","5  (milk, butter)          (bread)    0.500        1.00  1.000000\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/mlxtend/frequent_patterns/association_rules.py:186: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide\n","  cert_metric = np.where(certainty_denom == 0, 0, certainty_num / certainty_denom)\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/jupyter_client/session.py:203: DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future version.
